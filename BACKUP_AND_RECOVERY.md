# CoreFlow360 - Backup and Disaster Recovery Guide

> **Production-Ready Backup and Disaster Recovery Procedures**
> 
> This document provides comprehensive guidance for backup operations, disaster recovery procedures, and business continuity planning for CoreFlow360.

## <¯ Overview

CoreFlow360 implements a multi-layered backup and disaster recovery strategy designed for:

- **Zero Data Loss**: Point-in-time recovery with transaction-level precision
- **Minimal Downtime**: Recovery procedures targeting <15 minute RTO
- **Automated Operations**: Scheduled backups with monitoring and alerting
- **Security**: Encrypted backups with access controls
- **Compliance**: Audit trails and retention policies

## = Backup Strategy

### Backup Types

#### 1. Database Backups
- **Full Backups**: Complete database dump (daily at 2 AM UTC)
- **Incremental**: Transaction log backups (every 15 minutes)
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Up to 30 days of transaction logs
- **Retention**: 7 days local, 90 days cloud, 7 years archive

#### 2. Application Backups
- **Code Repository**: Git-based with multiple remotes
- **Environment Configuration**: Encrypted config backups
- **File Uploads**: User-generated content backups
- **Cache State**: Redis snapshots for faster recovery

#### 3. Infrastructure Backups
- **Server Images**: AMI snapshots (weekly)
- **Configuration**: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- **SSL Certificates**: Automated renewal with backup
- **Secrets**: Encrypted vault backups

## > Automated Backup System

### Database Backup Script

```bash
# Run daily backup
./scripts/backup-database.sh

# Run backup with cloud upload
./scripts/backup-database.sh --cloud

# Run backup with custom retention
./scripts/backup-database.sh --retention-days 30
```

### Backup Configuration

#### Environment Variables

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db

# Security
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-encryption-key
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=7

# Cloud Storage
AWS_BACKUP_BUCKET=coreflow360-backups
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key

# Notifications
NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK=https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook
ALERT_EMAIL=admin@coreflow360.com
ALERT_SMS_WEBHOOK=https://api.twilio.com/your/sms/endpoint
```

#### Cron Schedule

```bash
# Add to crontab
crontab -e

# Daily full backup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /path/to/coreflow360/scripts/backup-database.sh --cloud

# Weekly backup verification
0 3 * * 0 /path/to/coreflow360/scripts/verify-backup.sh

# Monthly disaster recovery test
0 4 1 * * /path/to/coreflow360/scripts/dr-test.sh
```

### Backup Verification

The backup system automatically verifies:
- File integrity (checksums)
- PostgreSQL dump validity
- Encryption/decryption cycles
- Restore capability tests

## =¨ Disaster Recovery Procedures

### Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

| Scenario | RTO Target | RPO Target | Procedure |
|----------|------------|------------|-----------|
| Database Corruption | 15 minutes | 15 minutes | Automated restore from latest backup |
| Application Failure | 5 minutes | 0 minutes | Automated restart with health checks |
| Full System Failure | 30 minutes | 30 minutes | Full disaster recovery protocol |
| Data Center Outage | 60 minutes | 30 minutes | Cross-region failover |

### Emergency Response

#### Severity Levels

**=â LOW (Degraded Performance)**
- Single service impacted
- Backup systems functional
- User impact: Minimal

**=á MEDIUM (Service Disruption)**
- Multiple services affected
- Some data loss risk
- User impact: Moderate

**=4 HIGH (System Down)**
- Critical systems offline
- Immediate data loss risk
- User impact: Severe

**=¨ CRITICAL (Disaster)**
- Complete system failure
- Infrastructure compromised
- User impact: Complete outage

### Recovery Procedures

#### 1. Assessment Phase

```bash
# Quick system assessment
./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh assess

# Expected output:
#  Database: ONLINE
#  Redis: ONLINE  
#  Application: RUNNING
#  Disk: OK (67%)
#  Backups: 3 recent backups
# <¯ System Status: HEALTHY
```

#### 2. Database Recovery

```bash
# Recover from latest backup
./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh recover-db

# Recover from specific backup
./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh recover-db backups/database/backup_20240101_020000.sql.gz.gpg

# With auto-confirmation (production)
AUTO_CONFIRM=true ./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh recover-db
```

#### 3. Application Recovery

```bash
# Recover application services
./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh recover-app

# Full system recovery
./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh full-recovery
```

#### 4. Verification

```bash
# Verify recovery success
./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh verify

# Manual verification checklist:
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/session
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
```

### Recovery Playbooks

#### Database Corruption Recovery

1. **Immediate Actions**
   ```bash
   # Stop application to prevent further corruption
   sudo systemctl stop coreflow360
   
   # Assess damage
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT pg_database_size('coreflow360');"
   
   # Create emergency backup if possible
   pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > emergency_backup_$(date +%s).sql
   ```

2. **Recovery Process**
   ```bash
   # Find latest valid backup
   ls -la backups/database/ | head -10
   
   # Perform recovery
   ./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh recover-db backups/database/latest_backup.sql.gz.gpg
   
   # Verify data integrity
   ./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh verify
   ```

3. **Post-Recovery**
   - Analyze root cause
   - Update monitoring thresholds
   - Review backup frequency
   - Document lessons learned

#### Complete Infrastructure Failure

1. **Emergency Response Team Activation**
   - Page on-call engineer
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Activate incident bridge

2. **Infrastructure Recovery**
   ```bash
   # Deploy infrastructure from code
   cd infrastructure/terraform
   terraform plan -var="disaster_recovery=true"
   terraform apply
   
   # Deploy application
   cd ../..
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   
   # Restore data
   ./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh full-recovery
   ```

3. **Service Restoration**
   - DNS updates for new infrastructure
   - SSL certificate deployment
   - Load balancer configuration
   - CDN cache invalidation

## >ê Recovery Testing

### Automated Testing

Monthly automated disaster recovery tests validate:
- Backup integrity and restore procedures
- Recovery time measurements
- Data consistency verification
- Application functionality post-recovery

### Testing Schedule

```bash
# Test backup integrity (daily)
0 1 * * * /path/to/scripts/test-backup-integrity.sh

# Test database recovery (weekly)
0 1 * * 6 /path/to/scripts/test-db-recovery.sh

# Full DR test (monthly)
0 1 1 * * /path/to/scripts/full-dr-test.sh

# Chaos engineering (quarterly)
0 1 1 */3 * /path/to/scripts/chaos-test.sh
```

### Manual Testing Procedures

#### Quarterly DR Drill

1. **Pre-Test Preparation**
   - Schedule maintenance window
   - Notify all stakeholders
   - Prepare test environment
   - Document baseline metrics

2. **Test Execution**
   ```bash
   # Create test scenario
   ./scripts/simulate-disaster.sh --scenario=database-corruption
   
   # Execute recovery
   time ./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh full-recovery
   
   # Verify results
   ./scripts/validate-recovery.sh
   ```

3. **Post-Test Analysis**
   - Compare actual vs target RTO/RPO
   - Document issues and improvements
   - Update procedures based on findings
   - Share results with stakeholders
