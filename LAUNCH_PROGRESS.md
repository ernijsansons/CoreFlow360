## Next Steps for User

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel**:
   ```bash
   # Generate a secure encryption key:
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```
   Then add to Vercel: `ENCRYPTION_KEY=<generated-key>`

2. **Add GitHub Secrets** for CI/CD:
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Get from Vercel dashboard
   - Add to: Settings → Secrets → Actions

3. **Test the build locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run build:production
   ```
