# CoreFlow360 Deployment Guide

This guide will help you successfully deploy CoreFlow360 to Vercel.

## üöÄ Quick Deployment

### Option 1: Automated Script
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh

# Run the deployment script
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# Ensure you're on main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Build the project
npm run build

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

## üîß Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables
Make sure these environment variables are set in Vercel:

**Required for Production:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Set to: `https://coreflow360.com`

**Optional but Recommended:**
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` - 64-character hex string
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - For payment processing
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI features

### 2. Vercel Configuration
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/ernijsansons-projects/core-flow360)
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Git
3. Ensure **Production Branch** is set to `main`
4. Verify the repository is connected correctly

### 3. Database Setup
1. Set up a PostgreSQL database (e.g., on Supabase, Railway, or Vercel Postgres)
2. Update the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
3. Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate deploy`

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Build Fails with Environment Validation
**Error:** `Environment validation failed: NEXTAUTH_SECRET: Required`

**Solution:**
- The build is now configured to use placeholders during build time
- Make sure you're using the latest code from the main branch
- Check that Vercel is building from the `main` branch, not `master`

### Issue 2: Vercel Building from Wrong Branch
**Problem:** Vercel is building from `master` instead of `main`

**Solution:**
1. Go to Vercel Project Settings ‚Üí Git
2. Change "Production Branch" from `master` to `main`
3. Save and redeploy

### Issue 3: Database Connection Issues
**Error:** `Database connection failed`

**Solution:**
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly in Vercel
2. Ensure the database is accessible from Vercel's servers
3. Check if the database requires SSL (add `?sslmode=require` to URL)

### Issue 4: Encryption Key Issues
**Error:** `Invalid encryption key: must be 64 character hex string`

**Solution:**
- The build now uses a valid 64-character placeholder
- For production, set a proper `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in Vercel environment variables

## üìã Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Code
```bash
# Ensure you're on main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Check for any uncommitted changes
git status
```

### Step 2: Test Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Run tests
npm run test

# Build locally
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
# Push to main branch (triggers Vercel deployment)
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/ernijsansons-projects/core-flow360)
2. Check the latest deployment
3. Monitor build logs for any errors
4. Wait for deployment to complete

### Step 5: Verify Deployment
1. Visit your site: https://coreflow360.com
2. Test key functionality
3. Check for any console errors
4. Verify environment variables are working
