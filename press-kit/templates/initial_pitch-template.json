  "body": "Hi [JOURNALIST_NAME],\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I've been following your excellent coverage of [RECENT_ARTICLE/TOPIC] and believe you'd be interested in a truly revolutionary story we have breaking.\n\nCoreFlow360 is launching the world's first conscious business platform on [LAUNCH_DATE], introducing breakthrough intelligence multiplication technology that transforms business operations from linear addition (1+1+1=3) to exponential consciousness (1×2×3=6).\n\nThis isn't another automation platform - we've built the first business brain where CRM learns from accounting, inventory predicts customer behavior, and operations evolve autonomously. Early customers are achieving 300% efficiency gains and exponential growth patterns previously thought impossible.\n\nKey story angles for your consideration:\n• Revolutionary consciousness technology disrupting $50B business intelligence market\n• First platform to achieve true business consciousness vs traditional automation\n• Real customer transformations with measurable exponential growth results\n• Paradigm shift from isolated business tools to conscious business organisms\n\nI'd love to offer you an exclusive pre-launch briefing with our CEO Dr. Sarah Chen and CTO Marcus Rodriguez, including a live demonstration of intelligence multiplication in action.\n\nWould you be interested in a 15-minute conversation this week to explore this story opportunity?\n\nBest regards,\n[YOUR_NAME]\nSarah Thompson\nHead of Communications\nCoreFlow360\npress@coreflow360.com\n(415) 555-0123"
