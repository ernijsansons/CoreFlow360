## 🔍 Monitor Your Deployment

### Check Build Progress:
1. Watch the build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Should take 2-4 minutes
3. Look for "Build completed" message

### Verify It's Live:
```bash
# Run our checker:
node check-deployment-status.js
```

### Expected Result:
```
✅ https://coreflow360.vercel.app - Status: 200 (Working!)
```

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Build Fails?
```bash
# Check locally first:
npm run build

# If local build works, it's an environment variable issue
```

### Environment Variable Issues?
- Make sure DATABASE_URL is a real PostgreSQL database
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET must be 32+ characters
- NEXTAUTH_URL must match your Vercel URL

### Still Not Working?
```bash
# Use our emergency script:
./deploy-to-vercel.sh

# Or try alternative platform:
# See DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md for 7 other methods
```
