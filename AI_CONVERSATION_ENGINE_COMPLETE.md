- No timeline or specific need

**BANT Framework Integration**:
```javascript
const qualificationFactors = {
  budget: { weight: 25, indicators: ['budgeted', 'approved', 'cost isn\'t issue'] },
  authority: { weight: 25, indicators: ['I decide', 'my company', 'I can approve'] },
  need: { weight: 30, indicators: ['must have', 'critical', 'solving problem'] },
  timeline: { weight: 20, indicators: ['urgent', 'this week', 'ASAP'] }
}
```

## üéÆ CONVERSATION EXAMPLES

### **HVAC Emergency Scenario**:
```
ü§ñ AI: "Hi John, this is Sarah from CoreFlow360 HVAC. I'm calling about your AC repair inquiry. I hope I'm catching you at a good time?"

üë§ Customer: "Yes, my air conditioning completely stopped working this morning!"

üß† Chain of Thought:
   1. Emergency situation detected ‚Üí High urgency
   2. Homeowner likely decision maker ‚Üí Good authority
   3. Summer heat = immediate need ‚Üí High qualification
   Decision: Score 8/10, proceed with same-day booking

ü§ñ AI: "Oh no! I can imagine how uncomfortable that must be, especially with today's heat. When did it stop working exactly?"

üë§ Customer: "Around 7 AM when I tried to turn it on. There's no cool air coming out at all."

ü§ñ AI: "That definitely sounds like it needs immediate attention. I can get one of our emergency technicians to you today. Are you the homeowner, so I can schedule this directly with you?"

üë§ Customer: "Yes, it's my house. How much is this going to cost?"

ü§ñ AI: "I understand cost is important. Our emergency service call is $150, and that includes a full diagnosis. If you approve any repairs, that fee is applied to the work. Most AC issues we see are $300-600 to fix. Does that work within your budget?"

üë§ Customer: "That seems reasonable if you can get me cool again today."

ü§ñ AI: "Absolutely! I have a technician available between 2-4 PM today. Would that work for you?"

üë§ Customer: "Perfect!"

ü§ñ AI: "Excellent! I've scheduled your appointment for today between 2-4 PM. You'll receive a confirmation text, and our technician will call 30 minutes before arrival. Is there anything else I can help you with?"

**RESULT**: Qualified lead (Score: 9/10), Same-day appointment booked, $450 potential value
```

### **Auto Insurance Approval Call**:
```
ü§ñ AI: "Good morning, this is Mike from CoreFlow360 Auto Body. I'm calling about claim #12345 for your insured, Sarah Johnson. I have the repair estimate ready for approval."

üè¢ Insurance: "Yes, I have the file open. What's the total estimate?"

ü§ñ AI: "The total is $3,247 for the rear-end collision damage. This includes bumper replacement, trunk repair, and paint work. Does that match your assessment?"

üè¢ Insurance: "I'm showing $3,100 in my system. Can you break down the difference?"

üß† Chain of Thought:
   1. Minor estimate discrepancy ‚Üí Normal negotiation
   2. $147 difference is small ‚Üí Likely resolvable  
   3. Adjuster engaged ‚Üí Good faith discussion
   Decision: Explain line items, maintain professional tone

ü§ñ AI: "Of course. The difference is primarily in paint labor - we're showing 8 hours at $65/hour, which is $520. Your estimate may be using a different labor rate. We also included color-match testing for the metallic finish, which is $127."

üè¢ Insurance: "Our labor rate for that area is $60/hour. Can you work with that?"

ü§ñ AI: "I can work with your rate. That brings us to $3,187. With the color-match requirement for this metallic blue, would you approve the full $3,187?"

üè¢ Insurance: "Yes, approved for $3,187. When can you complete the work?"

ü§ñ AI: "Perfect! We can start tomorrow and complete by Friday. I'll email you photos of the finished work and the final invoice. Thank you for the approval."

**RESULT**: Claim approved, $3,187 authorized, 4-day completion timeline
```
