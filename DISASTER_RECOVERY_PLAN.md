## üéØ Disaster Scenarios & Response

### 1. Database Failure
**Scenario**: PostgreSQL database becomes corrupted or inaccessible

**Response Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Verify database status
npm run dr:assess

# 2. Attempt automatic recovery
npm run dr:recover-db

# 3. If automatic recovery fails, restore from backup
npm run backup:restore --latest

# 4. Verify data integrity
npm run db:verify
```

**Recovery Time**: 15-30 minutes

### 2. Application Crash
**Scenario**: Application stops responding or crashes repeatedly

**Response Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Check application logs
vercel logs --num 100

# 2. Rollback to previous deployment
vercel rollback

# 3. If rollback fails, redeploy last known good version
git checkout <last-good-commit>
vercel --prod

# 4. Monitor health
npm run health:check
```

**Recovery Time**: 5-10 minutes

### 3. Security Breach
**Scenario**: Unauthorized access or data breach detected

**Response Steps**:
1. **Immediate Actions** (0-15 minutes)
   - Activate incident response team
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Rotate all secrets and API keys
   - Enable emergency maintenance mode

2. **Investigation** (15-60 minutes)
   - Review audit logs
   - Identify breach vector
   - Assess data exposure
   - Document timeline

3. **Remediation** (1-4 hours)
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Reset affected user passwords
   - Restore from clean backup if needed
   - Deploy security fixes

4. **Communication** (Within 72 hours)
   - Notify affected users
   - Report to authorities (GDPR requirement)
   - Update security advisories

### 4. Data Corruption
**Scenario**: Critical data becomes corrupted

**Response Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Identify corruption scope
npm run db:integrity-check

# 2. Restore specific tables from backup
npm run backup:restore --table=<table_name>

# 3. Reconcile data inconsistencies
npm run db:reconcile

# 4. Verify business logic
npm test
```

**Recovery Time**: 30-60 minutes

### 5. Third-Party Service Outage
**Scenario**: Critical service (Stripe, AWS, etc.) becomes unavailable

**Response Steps**:
1. **Detection**: Health monitors alert to service failure
2. **Failover**: Switch to backup service if available
3. **Degraded Mode**: Enable feature flags to disable affected features
4. **Communication**: Update status page with service limitations
5. **Recovery**: Re-enable services once restored

**Recovery Time**: Immediate (degraded mode)
