# CoreFlow360 - Deployment Status Update

## ‚úÖ Actions Completed

### 1. Fixed GitHub Actions
- Updated all deprecated actions to latest versions
- Added proper permissions for security workflows
- Fixed TruffleHog configuration

### 2. Fixed Twilio Integration Issue
- Identified that Twilio client was initializing at build time
- You added Twilio credentials to Vercel environment variables

### 3. Cleaned Up Git Configuration
- Added `.claude/` and `.vercel` to .gitignore
- Removed Claude settings from git tracking
- Switched to main branch
- Pushed latest changes

### 4. Triggered New Deployment
- Commit: `13f45f3` - "chore: Update gitignore and dependencies"
- Pushed to main branch at: ${new Date().toISOString()}
- This should trigger automatic deployment on Vercel

## üìä Current Status

- **GitHub Actions**: Should now pass ‚úÖ
- **Vercel Deployment**: In progress (triggered by push)
- **Branch**: main (up to date)

## üîç Next Steps

1. **Monitor Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/ernijsansons-projects
   - Check the build logs for your project
   - Verify all environment variables are set

2. **Expected Build Time**: 5-10 minutes

3. **Success Indicators**:
   - Build completes without Twilio errors
   - Site becomes accessible at your domain
   - No "credentials not configured" errors

## üö® If Deployment Still Fails

1. Check if all these environment variables are set in Vercel:
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`
   - `TWILIO_WEBHOOK_URL`
   - All other variables from `VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md`

2. If you see new errors, they're likely related to:
   - Missing environment variables
   - Database connection issues
   - Other service credentials

## üìù Important Notes

- Since you reconnected Vercel, you may have a new project ID
- The old deploy hook won't work anymore
- Get the new deploy hook from Vercel dashboard if needed
