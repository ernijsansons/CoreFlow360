```bash
# Delete consciousness directories
rm -rf src/components/consciousness/
rm -rf src/__tests__/consciousness/
rm -rf src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/evolution/
rm -rf src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/intelligence/

# Update any remaining references
find src -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" | xargs grep -l "consciousness" | while read file; do
  sed -i 's/consciousness/business-intelligence/g' "$file"
  sed -i 's/Consciousness/BusinessIntelligence/g' "$file"
done
```

### Priority 2: Create AI Command Center
```bash
mkdir -p src/app/ai
