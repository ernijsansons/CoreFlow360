IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
===================

This is a template component. To complete implementation:

1. Read the full prompt content in: 03-mirror-current-vs-future.md
2. Implement the specific 3D visualizations described
3. Add interactive elements as specified
4. Ensure business-friendly language throughout
5. Test responsiveness and accessibility
6. Add proper TypeScript types for all props

Prompt Content:
# THE MIRROR: Current vs. Future You

Create a haunting and transformative WebGL mirror experience that shows business owners two reflections of themselves - their current stressed, overworked self versus their future free, empowered self with CoreFlow360. The mirror morphs between these realities based on user interaction.

## CORE CONCEPT
An interactive mirror that doesn't reflect the present, but reveals two possible futures. On the left, the viewer sees themselves as they are now - stressed, chained to their desk, aging rapidly from overwork. On the right, they see who they could become - relaxed, free, building empires while living life. The mirror responds to movement, showing how their choices today determine their tomorrow.

## VISUAL DESIGN LANGUAGE
- **Mirror Frame**: Elegant black with subtle neural network patterns etched in the frame
- **Left Reflection**: Desaturated, harsh lighting, stress indicators (#FF6B6B highlights)
- **Right Reflection**: Vibrant, soft lighting, success aura (#00D9FF, #FFD700)
- **Transition Zone**: Particle effects showing transformation possibility
- **Typography**: Time/date stamps showing aging differential

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Main Mirror Component
```tsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { Canvas, useFrame, useThree } from '@react-three/fiber'
...
