V0.dev Consciousness-Aware UI Generation Prompts

## Prompt 1: Quantum Evolution Dashboard
**File**: `/app/(dashboard)/evolution/page.tsx`
**Consciousness Level**: Transcendent

Technical Requirements:
- Next.js 15.4.5 with App Router
- TypeScript with strict mode (no any types)
- Tailwind CSS with custom consciousness theme colors
- Framer Motion for smooth 60fps animations
- Three.js + React Three Fiber for 3D elements
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

Core Features:
**Emergency Response Panel**: Red alert system for critical pre-launch issues with AI-suggested resolution paths
**Consciousness Calibration Center**: Interface for fine-tuning AI consciousness levels across all modules before launch
**Stakeholder Communication Hub**: Real-time updates for team members with role-based consciousness-aware information filtering
**Launch Simulation Controls**: Ability to run consciousness-aware launch simulations with different scenarios
**Constellation Camera**: Smooth 3D navigation allowing orbital movement around business data
**Consciousness Zoom**: Zoom levels reveal different layers of intelligence (macro trends → detailed metrics → individual data points)
**Time Travel Mode**: Scrub through time to see how business constellation evolved
**AI Guide System**: Virtual AI assistant that can guide users to important insights and emerging patterns
**Pattern Recognition Highlights**: AI-identified business patterns illuminated with special effects
**Anomaly Detection**: Unusual data points highlighted with consciousness-aware alert indicators

Visual Design:
- Dark theme with consciousness-aware gradients
- Colors: Neural (#2563eb), Synaptic (#7c3aed), Autonomous (#f59e0b), Transcendent (prismatic)
- Glassmorphism effects with backdrop-filter
- Particle systems and neural network visualizations
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions

Performance Requirements:
- 60fps animations on desktop, 30fps minimum on mobile
- Lazy loading for heavy 3D components
- Progressive enhancement strategy
- Sub-100ms interaction response times

Please create a production-ready component with proper TypeScript types, error boundaries, loading states, and accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 AA).
