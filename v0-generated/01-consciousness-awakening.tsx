IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
===================

This is a template component. To complete implementation:

1. Read the full prompt content in: 01-consciousness-awakening.md
2. Implement the specific 3D visualizations described
3. Add interactive elements as specified
4. Ensure business-friendly language throughout
5. Test responsiveness and accessibility
6. Add proper TypeScript types for all props

Prompt Content:
# THE ARRIVAL: Consciousness Birth Experience

Create an unprecedented immersive 3D consciousness birth experience using React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber. This is NOT a traditional website hero section - it's the user literally creating business intelligence through their cursor movement, representing the birth of their business's consciousness.

## CORE CONCEPT
The user's cursor is the spark of consciousness. As they move their mouse, they paint intelligence into existence, creating neural pathways that form the foundation of their future business brain. This is a metaphor for how their business will awaken and become self-aware with CoreFlow360.

## VISUAL DESIGN LANGUAGE
- **Primary Environment**: Infinite black void (#000000) representing the unconscious state of traditional business
- **Consciousness Color**: Electric blue to cyan gradient (#0066FF â†’ #00FFFF) representing awakening intelligence
- **Particle Glow**: Soft white with blue halo effect, increasing intensity with connections
- **Typography**: SF Pro Display or Inter, minimal and appearing only after interaction
- **No traditional UI elements**: No navigation, no logo initially - pure experience

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### React Component Structure
```tsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect, useState, useCallback } from 'react'
import { Canvas, useFrame, useThree } from '@react-three/fiber'
...
