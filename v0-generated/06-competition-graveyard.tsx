IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
===================

This is a template component. To complete implementation:

1. Read the full prompt content in: 06-competition-graveyard.md
2. Implement the specific 3D visualizations described
3. Add interactive elements as specified
4. Ensure business-friendly language throughout
5. Test responsiveness and accessibility
6. Add proper TypeScript types for all props

Prompt Content:
# THE GRAVEYARD: Failed Software Cemetery

Create a haunting 3D cemetery experience where traditional software solutions rest in peace, while CoreFlow360 rises as the immortal solution. This visceral metaphor demonstrates why old approaches fail and how intelligence multiplication represents eternal business life.

## CORE CONCEPT
Users walk through a misty graveyard filled with tombstones of failed software approaches. Each grave tells a story of limitation. At the end, they witness CoreFlow360 rising from the ground as a luminous, living entity that cannot die because it evolves.

## VISUAL DESIGN LANGUAGE
- **Environment**: Gothic cemetery at twilight, volumetric fog, purple sky
- **Tombstones**: Weathered stone with epitaphs of software failures
- **Atmosphere**: Eerie but beautiful, transformation from death to life
- **Finale**: Brilliant emergence of living intelligence from the earth

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Main Cemetery Component
```tsx
import React, { useState, useRef, useEffect, Suspense } from 'react'
import { Canvas, useFrame, useThree, extend } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { OrbitControls, Fog, Sky, Text3D, useTexture, Float, SpotLight } from '@react-three/drei'
...
