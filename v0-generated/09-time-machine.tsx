IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
===================

This is a template component. To complete implementation:

1. Read the full prompt content in: 09-time-machine.md
2. Implement the specific 3D visualizations described
3. Add interactive elements as specified
4. Ensure business-friendly language throughout
5. Test responsiveness and accessibility
6. Add proper TypeScript types for all props

Prompt Content:
# THE TIME MACHINE: Future Business Preview

Create an immersive time-travel experience where users can literally step into their business 1-3 years after implementing CoreFlow360. They witness their future self, their autonomous business operations, and the life they've built through intelligence multiplication.

## CORE CONCEPT
Users start in a time machine cockpit, set their destination (1-3 years future), and are transported to witness their transformed business and personal life. They see their future self sleeping peacefully while their business runs itself, customers being delighted autonomously, and profits flowing without their direct involvement.

## VISUAL DESIGN LANGUAGE
- **Present State**: Cluttered office, stress indicators, manual work
- **Time Machine**: Sleek, chrome capsule with temporal effects
- **Future State**: Clean, automated office, peaceful owner, flowing profits
- **Transition**: Reality warping, time stream visuals, dimensional shifting

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Main Time Machine Component
```tsx
import React, { useState, useRef, useEffect, useMemo } from 'react'
import { Canvas, useFrame, useThree } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { OrbitControls, Environment, Float, Text3D, Html, Sphere, Trail } from '@react-three/drei'
...
