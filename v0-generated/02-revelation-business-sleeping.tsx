3. Add interactive elements as specified
4. Ensure business-friendly language throughout
5. Test responsiveness and accessibility
6. Add proper TypeScript types for all props

Prompt Content:
# THE REVELATION: Your Business Sleeping

Create a revolutionary split-screen experience showing the profound contrast between a business owner sleeping peacefully while their CoreFlow360-powered business works autonomously through the night. This visualization makes tangible the dream of true business freedom.

## CORE CONCEPT
A mesmerizing split-screen that shows the business owner in peaceful sleep on one side, while the other side reveals their business as a living, thinking organism making perfect decisions, serving customers, and growing revenueâ€”all without human intervention. Time accelerates to show an entire night's autonomous operations in minutes.

## VISUAL DESIGN LANGUAGE
- **Split Design**: Vertical split with subtle particle bridge connecting both sides
- **Sleep Side**: Deep blues and purples (#1a1a2e, #16213e) with dreamy atmosphere
- **Business Side**: Vibrant data streams in cyan/gold (#00FFFF, #FFD700) showing activity
- **Typography**: Large clock showing real time vs. business time differential
- **Transitions**: Smooth morphing between decisions being made

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Main Component Structure
```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'
...
