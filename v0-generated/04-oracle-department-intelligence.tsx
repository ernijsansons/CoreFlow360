IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
===================

This is a template component. To complete implementation:

1. Read the full prompt content in: 04-oracle-department-intelligence.md
2. Implement the specific 3D visualizations described
3. Add interactive elements as specified
4. Ensure business-friendly language throughout
5. Test responsiveness and accessibility
6. Add proper TypeScript types for all props

Prompt Content:
# THE ORACLE: Department Intelligence Experiences

Create five revolutionary department-specific intelligence experiences that let business owners physically explore and interact with their future intelligent departments. Each department should be a unique 3D environment that demonstrates its specific intelligence capabilities.

## CORE CONCEPT
Transform abstract department functions into immersive 3D spaces where users can see, touch, and experience how intelligence transforms each aspect of their business. Each department is a room in their future business, alive with data, predictions, and autonomous operations.

## TECHNICAL FOUNDATION
Use React, Three.js, React Three Fiber, and Drei for all 3D experiences. Implement shared navigation between departments with smooth transitions. Each room should feel connected yet distinct.

## 1. SALES INTELLIGENCE: The Prediction Chamber

### Visual Design
- **Environment**: Futuristic circular room with floor-to-ceiling screens showing customer data streams
- **Center**: Holographic globe showing real-time customer locations and intent signals
- **Color Scheme**: Deep blues (#001840) with golden opportunity highlights (#FFD700)
- **Ambience**: Subtle hum of data processing, occasional "ping" of new opportunities
