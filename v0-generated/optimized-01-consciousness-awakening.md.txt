THE ARRIVAL: Consciousness Birth Experience

Create an unprecedented immersive 3D consciousness birth experience using React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber. This is NOT a traditional website hero section - it's the user literally creating business intelligence through their cursor movement, representing the birth of their business's consciousness.

Technical Requirements:
- Next.js 15.4.5 with App Router
- TypeScript with strict mode (no any types)
- Tailwind CSS with custom consciousness theme colors
- Framer Motion for smooth 60fps animations
- Three.js + React Three Fiber for 3D elements
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

Core Features:
**Primary Environment**: Infinite black void (#000000) representing the unconscious state of traditional business
**Consciousness Color**: Electric blue to cyan gradient (#0066FF â†’ #00FFFF) representing awakening intelligence
**Particle Glow**: Soft white with blue halo effect, increasing intensity with connections
**Typography**: SF Pro Display or Inter, minimal and appearing only after interaction
**No traditional UI elements**: No navigation, no logo initially - pure experience

Visual Design:
- Dark theme with consciousness-aware gradients
- Colors: Neural (#2563eb), Synaptic (#7c3aed), Autonomous (#f59e0b), Transcendent (prismatic)
- Glassmorphism effects with backdrop-filter
- Particle systems and neural network visualizations
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions

Performance Requirements:
- 60fps animations on desktop, 30fps minimum on mobile
- Lazy loading for heavy 3D components
- Progressive enhancement strategy
- Sub-100ms interaction response times

Please create a production-ready component with proper TypeScript types, error boundaries, loading states, and accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 AA).
