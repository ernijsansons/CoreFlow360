IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
===================

This is a template component. To complete implementation:

1. Read the full prompt content in: 11-dream-versus-reality.md
2. Implement the specific 3D visualizations described
3. Add interactive elements as specified
4. Ensure business-friendly language throughout
5. Test responsiveness and accessibility
6. Add proper TypeScript types for all props

Prompt Content:
# THE DREAM VERSUS REALITY: Split-World Experience

Create a powerful split-screen reality where users can instantly switch between their current business nightmare and their future CoreFlow360 dream. The experience shows the stark contrast between manual chaos and automated paradise, making the choice viscerally obvious.

## CORE CONCEPT
Users control a toggle that instantly switches between two parallel realities: their current stressed business life and their future automated paradise. They can flip back and forth to see the dramatic difference, experiencing both the pain they're escaping and the dream they're building.

## VISUAL DESIGN LANGUAGE
- **Split Interface**: Vertical divider that users can drag to compare realities
- **Current Reality**: Dark, chaotic, stress-filled, overwhelming
- **Dream Reality**: Bright, peaceful, automated, flowing
- **Transition Effects**: Reality warping, color shifts, atmospheric changes

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Main Split Reality Component
```tsx
import React, { useState, useRef, useEffect, useMemo } from 'react'
import { Canvas, useFrame, useThree } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { OrbitControls, Environment, Float, Text3D, Html } from '@react-three/drei'
...
