IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
===================

This is a template component. To complete implementation:

1. Read the full prompt content in: 10-neural-command-center.md
2. Implement the specific 3D visualizations described
3. Add interactive elements as specified
4. Ensure business-friendly language throughout
5. Test responsiveness and accessibility
6. Add proper TypeScript types for all props

Prompt Content:
# THE NEURAL COMMAND CENTER: Business Brain Interface

Create an immersive 3D neural command center where users can literally plug into their business's nervous system. They experience controlling their entire operation through thought-like interfaces, seeing data flow like neural signals, and witnessing their business develop a mind of its own.

## CORE CONCEPT
Users enter a futuristic command center that resembles a giant brain. They can "connect" to different business functions through neural interfaces, see information flow as electrical impulses, and watch as the business brain makes increasingly sophisticated decisions autonomously.

## VISUAL DESIGN LANGUAGE
- **Environment**: Organic brain-like architecture with flowing neural pathways
- **Interfaces**: Thought-controlled floating panels and holographic displays
- **Data Flow**: Electrical synapses and neural signal visualization
- **Evolution**: Brain structure grows more complex as connections multiply

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Main Neural Command Center Component
```tsx
import React, { useState, useRef, useEffect, useMemo } from 'react'
import { Canvas, useFrame, useThree } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { OrbitControls, Float, Text3D, Line, Sphere, Html, MeshDistortMaterial } from '@react-three/drei'
...
